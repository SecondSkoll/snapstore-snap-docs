# Snap Store Proxy How-to guides

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with the Snap Store Proxy,
our *How-to* guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to
a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but may require
you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Alternatively, our *Tutorials* section contain step-by-step tutorials to help outline
what the Proxy is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims,
such as configuring revision overrides.

Take a look at our *Reference* section for technical details (such as the Overrides API
specs and authentication mechanism), and other supplementary reference materials.

Finally, for a better understanding of how the Snap Store Proxy works, our *Explanation*
section enables you to expand your knowledge.
